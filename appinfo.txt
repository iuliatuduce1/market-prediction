Market Predictor App

Description:
A straightforward Python application designed to predict stock market trends using decision tree regression and linear regression models.
The application uses a dataset (stocks.csv) that contains historical data of Microsoft stocks.

Directory Structure:
 - MarketAnalysis.ipynb, the Jupyter notebook
 - stocks.csv, our dataset

 Usage:
1. Run MarketAnalysis.ipynb to perform market prediction using the provided dataset.
2. Make sure you install the Jupyter Notebok module.
3. Explore and extend the functionality of the data preprocessing and prediction modules as needed.

Notes:
The application currently uses a decision tree regression model for prediction.
Users can easily extend the application to use other machine learning models by modifying the prediction module.
The application also includes data visualization features that allow users to plot the original and predicted stock prices.
